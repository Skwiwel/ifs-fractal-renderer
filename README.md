# IFS Fractal Renderer
## Work in progress
A program for creating [iterated function system (IFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system) fractals. The fractals are drawn in real time in the executable's window and the parameters are set with a visual user interface.

The window, user interface and canvas display are to be handled by code written in Go and the drawing in 64bit assembly.

This project is an excercise of mine in using assembly with Go and utilizing Golang's graphical display capabilities.
